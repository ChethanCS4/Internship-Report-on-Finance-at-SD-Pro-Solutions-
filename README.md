This project analyzes the financial performance of Vtricks Technologies over the period 2020–2024. It examines revenue growth, cost structure, profitability, liquidity, and efficiency using financial statements and ratio analysis to understand the company’s financial health and sustainability.

The objective of this internship project was to gain practical exposure to corporate finance functions while understanding the overall business operations of SD Pro Solutions. The study aimed to analyze the company’s organizational structure, industry position, financial performance, and strategic framework using both management and financial analysis tools.

The methodology followed in this project was descriptive and analytical in nature. The study relied on secondary data obtained from company records, financial statements, and official sources, along with insights gained during the internship period. Tools such as McKinsey’s 7S Framework, Porter’s Five Forces Model, SWOT analysis, and detailed financial statement analysis were used to evaluate both strategic and financial aspects of the organization.

The organizational analysis highlighted that SD Pro Solutions operates with a strong focus on innovation, customer-centric services, and agile workflows. The application of McKinsey’s 7S Framework showed alignment between strategy, structure, systems, and shared values, while Porter’s Five Forces analysis indicated a competitive industry environment with high rivalry and moderate entry barriers. The SWOT analysis identified strengths such as technological expertise and skilled workforce, along with opportunities in digital transformation and cybersecurity services.

The financial analysis covered a detailed review of the Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet over multiple years. Ratio analysis revealed strong liquidity, controlled leverage, improving profitability, and efficient utilization of assets. Although the company experienced losses in earlier years, a clear financial turnaround was observed with rising net profits, improved returns on equity, and better asset productivity in recent years.

The internship experience provided valuable hands-on learning in financial statement analysis, budgeting, cost control, and financial planning. Exposure to real-world financial data, ERP systems, and Excel-based analysis enhanced practical understanding beyond classroom concepts. The internship also contributed to the development of professional skills such as analytical thinking, communication, teamwork, and decision-making.

In conclusion, the project demonstrates that SD Pro Solutions has achieved financial stability and operational efficiency through disciplined management and strategic planning. The internship successfully bridged theoretical knowledge with practical application, offering meaningful insights into corporate finance and business analysis.
